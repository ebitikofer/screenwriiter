* visual exposition/scene direction warning,
* Character - action follows warning ^^combine cause it would eliminate work?
* Dialogue -
* Parenthetical - rare use warning, rewrite check warning, not spec script warning
* Extension -
* Transition - rare use warning, space/time passage warning
Shot - rare use warning, not spec script warning
